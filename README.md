# Vision
This project uses an RGB-D camera to detect the height and width of stairs. It processes depth and color data to provide accurate measurements, which can be used for various applications such as robotics, accessibility, and safety.

## Features
- Detects stair dimensions (height and width).
- Utilizes RGB-D camera data for precise measurements.
- Suitable for real-time applications.

## How to start
- conda env create -f stair_detection.yml
- python stair_detection_ver.py

## For Matlab
- Execute 'Matlab\stair_detection\stair_detectoin_testv4.m' file to check matlab simulation.
